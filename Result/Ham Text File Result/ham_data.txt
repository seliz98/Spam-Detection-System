A00008281Z7EL3AO1UQD7,cute
A000123613N4QBI2JI0JD,the case feels a bit cheap but overall its a nice case a but hard to use when a call comes in but if you usually use headsets it wont be a problem
A000244435OT5FBABPR4J,i was searching through amazon looking for a new case because i was tired of my old otterbox that was getting washed up i stumbled upon this one and thought it would be a great fit it came in the mail in about 5 days and i was excited to start using itat first i was very pleased with the case it looked sleek and it was protective i got the navy blue matte finish one for the iphone 4 the adapter hole to charge the phone was a little to small the adapter would fit but it would fall out if you were using the phone which became frustrating really fast but the major problem was that the corners of the matte finish on the back of the case started to peel off this started about two weeks after i started to use it
A00026861LL8FKLSE1O0S,i liked it but it didt protect my screen from cracking so it was very disappointing  i wouldnt recommend it
A00026861LL8FKLSE1O0S,very poor quality it comes in two parts and it doesnt stay together  this case looks nice online but when it came to me it was very flimsy
A0002730WOKVUCGRLYJU,the adapter snapped as soon as i put my phone to charge the headphone cable is extremely longu get 0000 stars dont buy this shit people
A000443821AD43TOGKNGZ,i chose this rating because it was hard to get my phone into the case and i broke a nail because of it
A00057621NM70611JIO97,the cords are cheap and it shows why the charger goes in the phone rough and it comes out worse the cords also break very easy
A00060661O5Y63JM18F33,this product was very well made and will last forever but it just doesnt work as a belt clipdamages dress belts with minimum usenot secure on wide beltsscreen faces out so it is exposed to possible damage and nosy peoplei am very impressed with all the other products from this company but they need to put more through into a belt clip design
A00062283LKXEZFY9NQ8B,it is good for me to recharge the battery in my cell phone maybe it works in other cell phone but not mine
